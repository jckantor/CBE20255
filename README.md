# Introduction to Chemical Engineering Analysis

_Introduction to Chemical Engineering Analysis_ demonstrates the analysis of chemical processes and products use of mass and energy balances for the . These notebooks in the repository show how to prepare and analyze conceptual flowsheets for chemical processes, perform generation-consumption analysis, and perform basic engineering calculations for stoichiometry, reactor performance, separations, and energy analysis. Study of these topics prepares students for subsequent coursework in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

The notebooks include executable Python 3 code demonstrating basic chemical engineering calculations. Clicking the links to these notebooks opens them in a browser window hosted by Google CoLaboratory. Google CoLaboratory and a web browser is all you need to execute these notebooks, there is no need to download and install any other software. 

Alternatively, these notebooks can be downloaded and executed in a Python development environment that includes Jupyter notebooks. In particular, these notebooks were developed and tested using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
