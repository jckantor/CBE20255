    "\n",
    "The Martian atmosphere is primarily carbon dioxide (96 mole %) at a nominal pressure of 600 Pa (compared to a standard Earth atmosphere of 101,325 Pa). \n",

    "### Review of Reaction Chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we review a collection of relevant chemical reactions with proven technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sabatier Reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Sabatier reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction) \n",
    "\n",
    "$$CO_2 + 4\\,H_2 \\longrightarrow CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a mildly exothermic reaction for the production of methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen over a catalyst at elevated temperatures. Nickel catalysts have been used for this reaction, although ruthenium on alumina has been found to be more efficient. The [reactor can be a steel pipe filled with catalyst](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120016419.pdf) and surrounded by appropriate cooling system. About 80% conversion of the $CO_2$ is achieved with a field consisting of a stoichiometric ratio of $H_2$/$CO_2$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The technology has been demonstrated on a pilot plant scale by Audi as a component of an 6.3 megawatt 'electricity to gas' [etogas](http://www.etogas.com/) project, and for the [methanation of industrial waste gases](http://www.etogas.com/en/references/article///methanation-plant-for-treating-co2-residual-gases-in-an-industrial-process/) formed in the production of carbon components.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "With sufficient external energy, water can be split into oxygen and hydrogen\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2\\,H_2O \\longrightarrow 2\\,H_2 + O_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by a variety of chemical mechanisms. On an industrial scale, the [high pressure electrolysis (HPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_electrolysis) of water is a promising technology under active development by the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress15/ii_b_4_mittelsteadt_2015.pdf), [Mitsubishi](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1464285904002135), and for use in [space missions by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2012-4128). With [membrane systems for HPE](https://www.sintef.no/globalassets/project/novel/pdf/2-4_nrckurchatov_fateev_public.pdf), the hydrogen stream is leaves the cathode of the device under high pressure and separated from the oxygen and liquid water stream leaving from the anode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photoelectric and thermal processes for water splitting are also in various stages of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reverse Water Gas Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "The water gas shift reaction is carried out on enormous scale in the commercial production of ammonia and other applications. The [reverse water gas shift (RWGS)](http://www.marspedia.org/index.php?title=Reverse_Water-Gas_Shift_Reaction) is the slightly endothermic reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CO_2 + H_2 \\longrightarrow CO + H_2O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "carried out over a catalyst. The reaction typically demonstrates a 60% conversion at a $CO_2$/$H_2$ feed ratio of 4:1, 1 atm, and a temperature of 350 $^\\circ$C.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bosch Reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Bosch reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosch_reaction) is an exothermic reaction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to produce elemental carbon and water. The reaction is conducted at relatively high temperatures of 530-730 $^\\circ$C over an iron catalyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "More [recent research](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120016369.pdf) has shown the Bosch reaction can be broken into two stages. The first stage is the reverse water gas shift as shown above, the second stage is the catalytic reduction of carbon monoxide to carbon over an iron catalyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CO + H_2 \\longrightarrow C(s) + H_2O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the operational advantages of operating as a two stage device, we will use this reaction in place of the more conventional definition of the Bosch reaction.\n",
