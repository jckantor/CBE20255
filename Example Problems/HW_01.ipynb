      "A folk recipe for a homemade ant killer is to mix equal amounts of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate $NaHCO_3$) and powdered sugar, then spread the mixture in areas infested with ants. The theory is that the ants will be attracted to the sugar, eat some of the mixture, and carry more back to their nest to feed others. The ingested sodium bicarbonate will then react with formic acid present in the ants digestive tract to form a lethal amount of carbon dioxide gas ($CO_2$). \n",

      "Assuming the other reaction products are water and sodium formate ($HCOONa$), write a balanced reaction for what happens inside the ant's digestive tract.\n",
