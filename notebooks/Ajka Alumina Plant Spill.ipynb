    "On Monday, October 4th, 2010, an earthen dam failed at an alumina ore processing facility near [Ajka, Hungary](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/09/a-flood-of-red-sludge-one-year-later/100158/), resulting in the release of red mud over a large area in western Hungary. According to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/world/europe/06hungary.html), a flood of 700,000 cubic meters of sludge swept cars off bridges, damaged roads, and flooded businesses and homes throughout the affected region. There were reports of up to eight deaths and hundreds of displaced families. The red mud entered creeks about 45km upstream of the Danube raising the potential for devastating environmental damage. At the time there were fears that other earthen dams at the same processing facility were showing signs of impending failure."

    "'Red mud' (or 'red sludge') is the by-product of processing of [bauxite ore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite) to produce alumina. Alumina has a wide variety of commercial uses including plastic fillers, catalysts, textile dyes, sunscreens, ceramics, and as the raw material for the production of aluminum metal. The [Bayer process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process) is the most commonly used process for the refining of bauxite ore.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bayer process, the aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) present in the raw bauxite ore is digested in a hot solution of caustic soda (NaOH) at 175 &deg;C. The caustic solution reacts selectively with the aluminum oxide to produce aluminum hydroxide that dissolves in solution. The other components in the bauxite ore do not dissolve and are mechanically separated from the liquid stream. The stream of solid waste and entrained processing liquid forms the 'red mud' that was stored behind the earthen dam at the Hungarian facility. \n",
    "\n",
    "News reports suggest the red mud produced at this facility was stored with no further processing. This would be inconsistent with modern practice in plants of this type, but if true then the processing liquid entrained in the red mud would be highly caustic and constitute a significant health and environmental hazard.\n",
    " \n",
    "The purpose of this project is to use your chemical engineering knowledge to gain a deeper understanding of the issues associated with this tragedy. In particular, the news reports provide little hard information about the actual health or environmental hazards posed by the red mud. Some reports refer to the trace metal content, others cite the caustic components with pH ranging from 10 to 13. \n",
    " \n",
    "We approach this problem starting with the basic chemistry involved in the processing bauxite to produced refined alumina. From this we develop a simple process flowsheet and determine the basic operating constraints on the process. This provides a basis for a worst case estimate of the caustic component of the red mud and assessing possible remediation strategies."

    "There have been several proposals for remediating the environmental impacts of spilled red mud. At the time of the spill, one village poured vinegar into a river contaminated by the red mud. Suppose 10,000 cubic meters of sludge entered a creek. Assuming vinegar is approximately 5 wt% acetic acid, how much vinegar would be needed to completely neutralize the effects of the red mud?  Roughly how many railroad tank cars would be required to transport the vinegar?"
