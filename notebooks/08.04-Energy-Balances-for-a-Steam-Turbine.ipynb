    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "10 kg/sec of water at 1 bar absolute pressure and 50 $^\\circ$C is pumped isothermally to a pressure of 10 bar absolute, then fed to a boiler. The net heat input to the boiler is 29,490 kJ/sec. The boiler produces steam at 10 bar absolute which then enters a turbine. The exhaust leaving the turbine is saturated steam at 1 bar absolute.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the pump work?\n",
    "2. What is the temperature of the steam produced by the boiler?\n",
    "3. What is the turbine work produced?\n",
    "4. What is the thermal efficiency (i.e., net work out/net heat in) for this system?\n",
    "5. Locate the outlet conditions of the boiler and of the steam turbine on the attached T-S diagram. Do the specifications satisfy the second law of thermodynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Steam tables are provided. If needed, you can assume the heat capacity of liquid water is 4.2 kJ/kg-C and for steam is 1.9 kJ/kg-C. "
