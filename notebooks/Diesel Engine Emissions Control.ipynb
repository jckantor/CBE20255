      "Diesel engines offer greater energy efficiency than equivelently sized gasoline engines by operating at higher compression and combustion temperatures. The problem, however, is that diesel engines produce more particulates because the fuel is injected late in the compression cycle, and produces greater NO<sub>x</sub> emissions because of the higher combustion temperatures. \n",
